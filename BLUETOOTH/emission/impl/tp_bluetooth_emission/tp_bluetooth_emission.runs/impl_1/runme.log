WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 mem/data_reg has an input control pin mem/data_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: mem/Q[6]) which is driven by a register (cptr_addr_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
