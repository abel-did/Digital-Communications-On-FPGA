# Digital Communications and Linkages

This repository focuses on various aspects of digital communications and linkages, particularly within the context of digital hardware design. Here, you will find essential information about architectures, FPGA implementations, error detection, and much more.
Architectures
Low-Speed Serial Transmission

### UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter): 
This section covers the fundamentals of asynchronous serial communication and how to implement it in VHDL.
### SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): 
Explore the workings of the SPI bus and how to use it for communication between different electronic components.
### I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): 
This section delves into I2C, another widely-used serial communication protocol, and its VHDL implementation.

## High-Speed Serial Transmission

### Ethernet: 
Dive into the basics of Ethernet communication, including protocols, frames, and how to implement an Ethernet interface in an FPGA system.

## Error Detection Code

### CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check): 
Learn how CRC is used to detect errors in transmitted data and how to implement it in VHDL to ensure data integrity.

## FPGA Implementation
### VHDL
This section covers the necessary revisions to gain proficiency in VHDL, the essential hardware description language for FPGA design.
Learn how to use assertions and reports to enhance the reliability of your VHDL code.

### Simulation (ModelSim)
Discover the use of ModelSim and explore TCL scripts to automate simulation phases of your digital design.

### FPGA: Basic Structure of an Artix 7
Understand the internal structure of an Artix 7 FPGA, including key elements such as Look-Up Tables (LUTs), Flip-Flops (DFFs), and slices.

### Implementation (on a Basys3 board with Vivado)
Learn how to implement your design on a Basys3 FPGA board using the Vivado environment.

### Synthesis
Verify your VHDL code for potential errors and ensure it is ready for FPGA implementation.

### STA (Timing Analysis)
Explore timing analysis with the use of SDC constraints for a single clock.
Measure slack, calculate the maximum frequency of your system, and identify the critical path to ensure optimal performance.

### Placement and Routing
Gain insights into the placement and routing of your FPGA design, including statistics such as the number of LUTs, DFFs, and slices used.
